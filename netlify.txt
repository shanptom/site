The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by an error in parsing a file named "index.js" at "/src/pages/pensieve/index.js" due to a possible syntax error or the file type not being recognized by Gatsby.

**Solution:**
1. Check the file "index.js" at "/src/pages/pensieve/index.js" for any syntax errors.
2. Verify that the file is a valid JavaScript file that Gatsby can parse.
3. Ensure that any GraphQL fragments or queries in the file are correctly formatted.
4. Make necessary corrections to the file to address any syntax errors or adjust the file type if needed.

If the issue persists after checking and correcting the file, consider the following additional steps:
- Verify the package is in the package.json or the file was committed to the repo.
- Update Node.js version by following the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).
