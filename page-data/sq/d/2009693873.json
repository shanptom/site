Within a year, I was promoted to Senior Research Fellow, taking on broader responsibilities across multiple molecular taxonomy projects. During this time, I co-authored a peer-reviewed publication and gained hands-on experience in cutting-edge genomic techniques.</li>\n<li>Later, I joined a project funded by the Ministry of Environment Sciences (Govt. of India), where I explored the potential of paleoenvironmental DNA (PalEnDNA) as an indicator of past sea-level changes. This interdisciplinary research involved everything from field sampling and lab analysis to data interpretation and manuscript writing. I published two first-author research papers (CiteScores: 4.5 and 8.9) and presented my findings at the PAGES Open Science Meeting 2017 in Zaragoza, Spain.</li>\n<li>I was also honored to be selected as one of 25 researchers across India to attend an advanced workshop on aquatic microbiology and bioinformatics, sponsored by the Govt. of India and INRAE France, held in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.</li>\n<li>These formative experiences built the foundation for my current work in microbial ecology and high-throughput sequencing.</li>\n</ul>"}}]}}}
